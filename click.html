        <h1>Who is Gary Gensler and Why does he want to destroy the crypto world?</h1>
        <p>Gary Gensler regulates crypto like we are a 3rd world country...  frivolously suing projects even after they comply with SEC guidelines. while big banks buy off our politicians, to get them to attack crypto</p>
        <h3> Here's what banks have paid in fines since 2008:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>JP Morgan Chase: $39 billion</li>
            <li>Bank of America: $91.2 billion</li>
            <li>Citigroup: $25.5 billion</li>
            <li>Goldman Sachs: $16 billion</li>
            <li>HSBC: $2 billion</li>
            <li>Wells Fargo: $21.6 billion</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>I know you are wondering how a bank that pays, for example, $39 BILLION in fines (!!) keep making profit?</h3>
        <p>These are the reasons</p>
          <ol>
            <li>They keep your money in their system, by lobbying against crypto adoption</li>
            <li>They loan your money to crooked corporations, that pay them huge interest rates</li>
          </ol>
        <p>These are the unhealthy things Gary Gensler and the banks are doing.</p>

      <h1>WHAT INSPIRED THE FORMATION OF UNFKüñï?</h1>
      <P>on the morning of May 18th, 2011:pranksters from a group I've helped fund called the rainforest action network walked towards the entrance of disney HQ in burbank, california dressed as mickey and minnie mouse. minutes later, a 35 foot banner unfurls across their entrance arch:‚ÄúDISNEY: DESTROYING INDONESIA'S RAINFORESTS." The pranksters then locked down the main entrance gates to the company‚Äôs burbank headquarters‚Äîblockading disney‚Äôs top executives from arriving to work. It lasted just short of an hour. no one was harmed. all executives eventually made it to cushy, corner offices. Not before helicopter and satellite news trucks arrived to record the scene.</P> 
      <h3>I know you'd ask yourself this question...Why the commotion?</h3>
      <p>because at the time, disney was the largest publisher of kids‚Äô books in the world and they were printing them on virgin paper, the jungle book was also being printed on the jungle</p>
      <p>within a week, disney senior execs flew to SF to meet with rainforest action network's team.....for disney, it is easier for them to make change, than to get bad PR. 15 months later, october 11th 2012, disney makes an announcement that shocked the world they said they would  stop the use of paper connected to the destruction of endangered forests, completely!,A single hour-long prank saved literally millions of acres of trees.</p>
      <p>this prank was the inspiration for UNFK which stands for 'united for kindness' and with what UNFK have up their sleeve, UNFK are about to make some f-king noise starting with the campaign against Gary Gensler, demanding he resigns. UNFK will then explode into the mainstream going after the companies dumping chemical waste in our rivers and oceans, those spraying cancerous pesticides on your food, those putting microplastics in your balls and the banks that keep funding it</p>

    <div class="fourth" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h1>What does UNFK aim to achieve with all they are doing?</h1>
      <p>UNFK will build a community of millions connected on their revolutionary mobile app, that gamifies the pranks together, UNFK‚Äôll pull virtual and IRL stunts that get covered by every major media outlet and afterwards, celebrate the wins with parties you tell your grandkids about. As a member, you'll help shape UNFK missions join in pranks and parties and you'd be eligible for kindness rewards - the weekly prizes given in SOL</p>
      <p>NOTE:this is pranking - not protesting. UNFK find campaigns that hurt small businesses and civilians to be ineffective and embarrassing. UNFK are not anti-capitalist, nor is UNFK mission political because we all want a world where kindness comes before corporate greed. This is about good vs evil and in this fight, none of us are alone, there are so many savvy investors and strong communities have been a f-k yes to joining UNFK... and UNFK is just getting started</p>
